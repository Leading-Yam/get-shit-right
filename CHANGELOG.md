- Smart merge — deduplication, cross-referencing, contradiction detection, signal reinforcement
- Actionable research gaps — each gap linked to scoring dimension with suggested founder action
- Estimated maintenance cost — tech stack cost range + budget check from founder interview
- Monthly Runway Budget question in idea interview

### Changed
